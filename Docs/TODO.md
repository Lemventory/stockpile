## ðŸ“‹ To-Do & Optimization Recommendations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting to reduce initial load time
   - Add memoization for expensive computations in the UI
   - Optimize UI rendering by minimizing unnecessary re-renders

2. **Backend Optimization**
   - Implement database query optimization with proper indexes
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Consider using connection pooling more efficiently

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Implement pagination for large inventory lists
   - Add filtering capabilities directly in the API
   - Consider GraphQL for more flexible data fetching

### Feature Additions

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication system
   - Add role-based access control
   - Store password hashes using bcrypt or Argon2

2. **Sales Management**
   - Develop point-of-sale interface
   - Implement transaction history and reporting
   - Add receipt generation functionality

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Create sales and inventory analytics
   - Implement product popularity tracking
   - Add revenue forecasting capabilities

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Enhance the UI for better mobile experience
   - Consider developing native mobile applications

5. **Deployment & DevOps**
   - Create Docker containers for easier deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures

## ðŸ”’ Security Implementation

The system implements several security measures:

- Strict input validation on both frontend and backend
- Type-checked password hashing (to be implemented)
- CORS protection for API endpoints
- Database credentials management
- Separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
# Backend tests
cabal test

# Frontend tests (to be implemented)
spago test
```
