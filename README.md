## Full-Stack Web Application Architecture Implementation: ðŸŽ‹ Dispensary Management System

A comprehensive full-stack web application for cannabis dispensary inventory and point-of-sale management, utilizing PureScript for frontend development with Haskell backend services, all underpinned by a PostgreSQL database infrastructure.

### Current Development Phase

The immediate focus is on the architectural enhancement of my LiveView implementation. The current iteration, which interfaces with a JSON file, is being refactored to incorporate real-time database querying with a 10-second refresh interval. To maintain system flexibility, I am preserving the lightweight JSON-based architecture as an alternative operational mode, primarily due to its minimal resource footprint and type-safety advantages. This functionality will be implemented as a configurable option within my existing configuration framework, facilitating a kiosk-mode display system for inventory management. A notable feature of the system is its implementation of fully composable sorting functionality, allowing for multiple sorting criteria to be stacked and individually configured for ascending or descending order, providing highly flexible inventory organization capabilities.

### Security Implementation Considerations

As I expand the system's capabilities, I am implementing robust authentication mechanisms and developing sophisticated database schemas specifically tailored for cannabis dispensary operations. This includes the integration of type-checked password hashing systems. While adhering to best practices by utilizing established cryptographic libraries rather than implementing custom solutions, my exploration of cryptographic principles provides valuable insights into fundamental security concepts, such as the cardinal rule of never storing plaintext passwords and the importance of proper hashing implementations.

### Architectural Challenges and Solutions

A particular focus area is managing the temporal and spatial separation between frontend and backend components. My current solution employs strict monadic parsing at the input boundary, which has proven effective. However, as I expand the Haskell backend's capabilities to include its own monadic parsing operations, I must carefully balance computational resources. I am maintaining my architectural principle of prioritizing input boundary parsing to optimize system performance.

This approach ensures robust type safety while maintaining system efficiency, creating a foundation for a scalable and secure cannabis dispensary management system that handles both inventory and point-of-sale operations efficiently.
